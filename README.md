# Portfolio_Website
A basic website using HTML and CSS by a rookie. Also my first ever Web Dev project.

This website was built from scratch with the help of resources and tutorials available on the web.

All the resarch and the actual coding of this project was done within 48 hours.

Being a rookie and an amateur to the world of Web Dev. I had to do a lot of research and basic training for this project to actually work.

All the critiques and suggestions are always welcomed.
